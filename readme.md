# Travelling Salesman Problem Solver

This project is a Python implementation of a genetic algorithm for solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP).

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them:

- Python 3.8 or higher

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the necessary packages

## Usage

To run the program, execute the `tsp.py` file. The program will generate a random instance of the TSP and attempt to solve it using a genetic algorithm. Modify the CITIES variable to provide coordinates.
